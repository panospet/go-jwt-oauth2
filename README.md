# go-jwt-oauth2
Provides mechanisms for JWT authorization handling and oauth2 sign in. 
`examples` directory contains examples for each implementation separately, and both combined as well.

Extendable for:
- other oauth2 implementations in future
- JWT storage other than redis, if possible

_JWT implementation inspired from [here](https://learn.vonage.com/blog/2020/03/13/using-jwt-for-authentication-in-a-golang-application-dr/)._
